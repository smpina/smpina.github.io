I am currently studying Biochemistry at California Polytechnic State University. More specifically, I am in the middle of the organic chemsitry series. Taking organic chemistry this year has really sparked my interest in the field!

### More Information

I am from Fillmore, CA, which is only about 2 hours south of SLO. Some of my hobbies outside of school include cooking and rollerskating.
